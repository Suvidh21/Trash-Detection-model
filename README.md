Urban areas face constant challenges with waste accumulation.
This project introduces a smart trash detection system that leverages computer vision and AI to monitor public areas using traffic cameras and identify trash build-up automatically.

The idea is to help municipalities detect, locate, and respond faster to waste accumulation using existing infrastructure — a crucial step toward building sustainable smart cities 🏙️.

# 🗑️ Trash Detection Model using YOLOv3

An AI-powered **trash management system** that uses **YOLOv3 object detection** to identify and locate garbage in real time.  
The goal is to **detect random trash accumulation on streets** using existing **traffic cameras**, enabling **faster cleanup alerts** and contributing to **smarter, cleaner cities**. 🌍✨

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Trash Detection Model** is a computer vision system designed to:
- Identify trash or waste items from live video feeds.
- Send automated alerts for cleanup operations.
- Support municipal authorities and smart city initiatives for efficient waste management.

The model was trained using a **custom annotated dataset** containing various types of trash, litter, and waste categories.
